# AllConnectionsEnabled
Enables all connections, except for Amazon Music. You will have to enable that via experiments.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin does not make the connections function, meaning for example if you click on Twitter (the old Twitter connection, not the one labeled "X"), nothing pops up for connecting your account.
> Also, for example, Instagram, it opens the page in a web browser, but will always fail when redirecting back to Discord.
