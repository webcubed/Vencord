# Boo
A plugin for Vencord to hopefully avoid ghosting friends.


### Preview

- Orange Ghosty: indicates that you probably forgot to answer a question
- Other Ghosty: indicates that you are not the last chat participant to have sent a message

## Acknowledgements

### To-Do list (maybe)
(if ever)


- display a ghosty icon onto the "Home"/"Direct Messages" button with a "ghosty counter" (depressing) (similar to the friend request notifications)
- actually understand what I'm doing and make it coherent
- ran out of ideas
