# UserFlags

Add "flags" to users that will always show underneath their messages. ðŸš€

---

Want to never forget something about someone? See it on each of their messages? UserFlags is here for that.

UserFlags allows you to set "flags" on users, which are simply coloured notices shown under the target user's messages. You can set their type to either positive, info, warning or danger.
To set/edit a flag, run `/flag set` and fill in the options. To delete a flag, run `/flag delete`. It's that easy!

Just like some plugins, you might need to hover over older messages to show the flag.

Flags persist across restarts and are shown globally, including in DMs. Soon there will be per-server flags and even opt-in cloud synchronization!

Unlike notes, you can't miss a flag.
