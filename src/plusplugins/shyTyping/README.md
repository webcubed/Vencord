# ShyTyping

Prevents you from accidentally revealing that you're lurking in a channel.

Works with SilentTyping.

## What it does

Only allows the start typing logic to run when at least one the following conditions are met:

- The channel you are typing in is the voice channel you are currently in
- Your most recent editable message in the channel was posted within the past 5 minutes or 1 day (DMs and group chats)

These conditions are configurable.
